We are always looking for opportunities for you to earn more points, which is why we also give you a selection of Special Offers. These Special Offers are opportunities to earn bonus points on top of the regular points you earn every time you purchase a participating brand. No need to pre-select these offers, we'll give you the points whether or not you knew about the offer. We just think it is easier that way.
